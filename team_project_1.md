# Team Project Part 1

## Description

In your assigned team of 4, you'll collaboratively create a program with a database to analyze data from an open-sourced dataset. 

For example, your team might wish to examine the relationship between the length of a movie and the ratings users give the movie on a popular website. Or you may wish to explore the relationship between the size of a dog breed and the associated genetic ailments of that breed. Teams are encouraged to pick a dataset that interests you, is robust enough that you have flexibility to practice your skills, and that is well-suited for showcasing business impact.

The task in front of your team is deliberately open-ended. Your team will have to make decisions together:
* How will you select your dataset?
- Identify Potential Sources: Research various public data repositories such as government databases, academic research sites, and Statistics Canada that provide relevant data on minimum wage and unemployment rates.
- Criteria for Selection:
  - Relevance: Ensure the dataset includes variables related to minimum wage and unemployment rates across different provinces and time periods.
  - Completeness: The dataset should have minimal missing values and cover a significant time span to allow for robust analysis.
  - Accuracy: Verify that the data comes from reputable sources to ensure accuracy and reliability.
  - Format: Prefer datasets in formats that are easy to work with, such as CSV or Excel files.
  - Example Datasets: Statistics Canada, Labour Market Reports

* How will you make sure all team members can contribute to the project?
- Define Roles and Responsibilities: Assign specific tasks and roles based on each team memberâ€™s expertise and interests. For example, data cleaning, data analysis, regression analysis and report writing.
- Regular Meetings: Schedule meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps. Use collaborative tools for virtual meetings.
- Shared Workspace: Utilize collaborative platforms such as GitHub for code sharing and version control, and Slack for real-time communication.
- Documentation: Maintain thorough documentation of the project.

* How will you make decisions?
- Consensus-Based Decisions: Encourage open discussions and gather input from all team members before making decisions.
- Voting: For critical decisions where consensus cannot be reached, use a voting system to make a decision.
- Lead Roles: Assign lead roles for major components of the project.
- Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop where team members can raise concerns or suggest improvements at any stage of the project.

* What is the question you're trying to answer through your data analysis?
- What is the impact of minimum wage changes on unemployment rates across different provinces in Canada?
  - How does the relationship between minimum wage and unemployment rate vary across different provinces?
  - Are there any provinces where the minimum wage has a statistically significant impact on unemployment rates?
  - What other factors might influence the unemployment rate alongside minimum wage changes?

* What tasks need to be completed to get to your final output?
- Project Planning: Define the research question. Select the dataset and set up a shared workspace. Assign roles and responsibilities.
- Data Collection and Preparation:Collect the dataset from selected sources. Clean the data: handle missing values, format data, and ensure consistency. Merge datasets. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Analysis: Conduct descriptive statistics to summarize the data. Perform regression analysis to determine the relationship between minimum wage and unemployment rates. Analyze results and interpret the significance and strength of the relationships.
- Visualization: Create visualizations such as scatter plots, regression lines, and summary charts to illustrate the findings.
- Reporting: A comprehensive report detailing the impact of minimum wage on unemployment rates across Canada and its provinces.

* [Welcome - Ontario Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/)

The Technical Facilitator will deliver brief learning sessions on the following topics:

* GitHub and coding best practices when working in a team  
* How to communicate the value and impact of their work
  
This project applies skills from the following previous modules:

* Introduction to Building Software (Git, Shell & Python) 
* SQL 
* Applying Statistical Concepts (Linear regression, classification, and resampling) 

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of team project, participants will be able to:
* Resolve merge conflicts
* Describe common problems or challenges a team encounters when working collaboratively using Git and GitHub
* Create a program to analyze a dataset with contributions from multiple team members

## Instructions

1. Explore the open source datasets above.
2. As a team, decide which dataset you would like to analyze and determine:
We choose data set examining Unemployment rate in Canada and minimum wage
    1. What is the primary focus within the dataset?
    The primary focus within the datasets are to analyze labor force characteristics in Canada, including the unemployment rate, minimum wage, and other relevant economic indicators. The datasets aim to understand the dynamics of the labor market and how different variables influence the unemployment rate.
    2. What are potential relationships in the data that you could explore?
    Unemployment Rate vs. Minimum Wage:
Analyze how changes in the minimum wage impact the unemployment rate.
Unemployment Rate vs. Minimum Wage by Province:
Compare how changes in the minimum wage affect the unemployment rate across different provinces. Identify if some provinces experience more significant impacts than others.
The following would require additional datasets:
Unemployment Rate vs. GDP Growth Rate:
Explore how economic growth, as measured by GDP, affects unemployment.
Unemployment Rate vs. Economic Indicators (e.g., Inflation, Industry Growth):
Analyze how various economic indicators correlate with the unemployment rate.
    3. What are key questions your project could answer? 
    Impact of Minimum Wage on Unemployment:
How does an increase or decrease in the minimum wage affect the unemployment rate in Canada?
Demographic Analysis:
How do different demographic groups (e.g., age, gender) within the population experience changes in employment and unemployment?

COVID-19 Pandemic Impact:
How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect labor force characteristics from January 2020 onwards?

3. Create rules of engagement to guide how your team will work together (Examples can be found below under [Resources](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/team_project/edit/main/team_project_1.md#resources).
We used task tracking to guide team work. whcih can be found in the team project tracker
4. Create a new repository for your project. Hint: this repo has some features commonly found in industry repos.

## Questions to discuss when reviewing your dataset

* What are the key variables and attributes in your dataset?
Key variables and attributes in the dataset are :
- Year, minimum wage across across provinces/territories
* How can we explore the relationships between different variables?
* Are there any patterns or trends in the data that we can identify?
* Who is the intended audience for our data analysis?
The data can be directed at various groups. Government/ Policy makers/ Bank of Canada to help inform:
Interest rates hikes
minimum wage increases timeframe 
to inform business and greater public on decisions related to wage increase.  Employees are demanding  higher minimum wage to support increased cost. Some argue, current wage increases have not kept up with inflation conribution to current increasing gap between the middle and upper class.

This information can also be used to support small and medium size companies that and to help with economic incentatives to offset potential future minimum wage increases.

* What is the question our analysis is trying to answer?
* Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to our project requirements?
