### Project Report: Impact of Minimum Wage Changes on Unemployment Rates in Canada and across Canadian Provinces

#### Executive Summary

This report presents findings from an extensive analysis exploring the impact of minimum wage changes on unemployment rates across Canadian provinces. Leveraging datasets from Statistics Canada and the Government of Canada, our team conducted thorough data analysis and regression modeling to investigate the relationships between minimum wage adjustments and unemployment dynamics. Key findings reveal significant variations across provinces, underscoring the influence of regional economic contexts on policy outcomes. These insights are vital for informing stakeholders about the implications of minimum wage policies on labor market dynamics.

#### Project Overview

The project focused on analyzing labor market dynamics in Canada with a specific emphasis on minimum wage policies and their effects on unemployment rates. Through meticulous data selection, cleaning, and statistical modeling, our team aimed to uncover correlations and patterns between minimum wage changes and unemployment trends across different provinces.

#### Dataset Selection

Datasets were chosen based on rigorous criteria:
- **Relevance**: Included variables pertinent to minimum wage and unemployment rates across Canadian provinces.
- **Completeness**: Ensured minimal missing values and comprehensive coverage over significant time periods.
- **Accuracy**: Sourced data from reliable authorities such as Statistics Canada.
- **Format**: Preferred formats were CSV and Excel for compatibility with statistical software.

#### Team Collaboration

Effective collaboration was achieved through:
- **Defined Roles**: Team members were assigned roles based on expertise in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and project management.
- **Regular Meetings**: Scheduled meetings facilitated progress updates, decision-making, and feedback incorporation.
- **Shared Workspace**: Utilized GitHub for version control and Slack for real-time communication to streamline collaboration and documentation.
- **Documentation**: Maintained detailed records to track project progress, methodologies, and decisions throughout the project lifecycle.

#### Decision-Making Process

Decision-making was guided by:
- **Consensus-Based Approach**: Encouraged open discussions to gather input from all team members on critical decisions.
- **Voting**: Employed for resolving disagreements and making key project decisions when consensus was challenging.
- **Lead Roles**: Designated leads for specific project components to enhance accountability and streamline decision processes.
- **Feedback Loop**: Established mechanisms for continuous feedback to address concerns promptly and optimize project outcomes iteratively.

#### Research Questions

The analysis aimed to answer the following research questions:
- What is the impact of minimum wage changes on unemployment rates in Canada and across different provinces?

#### Findings

**Impact of Minimum Wage Changes:**
- **Regression Analysis for Averaged Canada**: Identified a statistically significant negative relationship (-0.3137 coefficient) between minimum wage and unemployment rate across Canada. The ùëÖ^2 value of 0.337 indicated that 33.7% of unemployment rate variation can be explained by minimum wage fluctuations.

**Regional Variation:**
- **Provincial Analysis**: Revealed diverse sensitivities to minimum wage changes; provinces like Quebec and New Brunswick exhibited strong correlations (e.g., ùëÖ^2 = 0.592 for Quebec), whereas Saskatchewan and Ontario displayed weaker correlations, suggesting influential roles of other economic factors.

#### Economic Insights and Future Research

Future research should delve into additional factors influencing unemployment rates and refine our understanding of Canadian labor market dynamics.

Key areas for future analysis include:
- Continued monitoring of minimum wage impacts on unemployment rates at national and provincial levels.
- Tailoring minimum wage policies to regional economic conditions and industry-specific factors.
- Exploration of broader economic contexts beyond minimum wage adjustments.
